# Dumb Ways to Die - The Ultimate List of Bizarre Fatalities

## 🚀 About the Project
**Dumb Ways to Die** is a hilariously tragic web app that allows users to log in and maintain a personalized list of the weirdest and most bizarre ways people have met their end. Whether it's getting stuck in a vending machine, challenging a goose to a fight, or mistaking a superglue bottle for eye drops—this app is here to document the most ridiculous send-offs in human history.

Every user gets a unique list based on their preferences, which they can edit, update, and share. The project is built using the MERN stack and demonstrates various backend and frontend concepts.
